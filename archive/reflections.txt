task record:
3 --- first try. pretty good? some people just focused on the blue line. turkers could not see each other.
4 --- repetition of 3. Local hill climbing from bad initialization.
5 --- I seeded it with some points. Helped.
6 --- tried without seeds again. misconstrued?
7 --- tried with seeds. still didn't quite get it.

8 --- only got 1, then a second later. (no major changes? how long after firing?)
9 --- increased wait time had no takers
10 --- short wait time, first one, then second later
11 --- longer wait time (6 min). slow takeup. do we need to focus on tasks that require just one or two people? but what about noise in that process? can produce sloooooooow.
